/* ### Q7 — Delivery SLA Breach by Carrier × Shipping Method

**Ops Head question:** *“Who’s missing the 5-day SLA, and by how much?”*

**SLA:** `delivery_days = delivered_at::date - shipped_at::date`. Late if `> 5`.

**Output:** `carrier, shipping_method, delivered_orders, avg_delivery_days, median_delivery_days, p90_delivery_days, late_deliveries, late_rate`

**Sanity check:** `avg_delivery_days <= p90_delivery_days` on every row (mean ≤ p90 in any sane distribution). `late_rate ∈ [0, 1]`.

**Pattern note:** `percentile_cont(0.9) within group (order by delivery_days)`. Many candidates have never used this — knowing it signals seniority. Shipments where `delivered_at IS NULL` are excluded (in transit). If `shipped_at > delivered_at` exists, surface it in your interpretation as a data quality finding.
