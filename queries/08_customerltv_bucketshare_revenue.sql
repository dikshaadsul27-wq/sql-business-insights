/* ### Q8 — Customer LTV + Bucket Share of Revenue

**CRM Lead question:** *“Who are our top spenders, and what share of revenue do they represent?”*

**Buckets:** `0-999`, `1000-4999`, `5000-19999`, `20000+`

**Output:** `customer_id, first_order_date, last_order_date, total_orders, total_revenue, aov, ltv_bucket, ltv_bucket_share_of_revenue`

**Sanity check:** `sum(total_revenue)` across all customers equals revenue from `ecom.orders` (excluding cancelled), within 0.5%. `ltv_bucket_share_of_revenue` summed across distinct buckets equals 1.0.

**Pattern note:** `case when` for bucketing; bucket-share-of-revenue needs a window: `sum(total_revenue) over (partition by ltv_bucket) / sum(total_revenue) over ()`. Mixing row-level and aggregate-level reasoning is a tier-up signal.
